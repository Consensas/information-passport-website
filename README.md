## About
An **[Information Passport](https://github.com/Consensas/information-passport/tree/main/docs#information-passport)**
is a _signed digital document_ that makes some claim,
for example "So and so was Vaccinated against COVID-19 on a certain date".
If the _signature_ matches the _public key_ of the digital document, the
document is **Verified**.
If the **Claim** made in the document checks against a set of (use-defined) rules
_and_ the "fingerprint" of the public key is known, we say the document is
**Validated**.

A **Vaccination Passport** is an Information Passport that
provides digital proof of a Vaccination.
A **Test Record Passport** is an Information Passport that provides
digital proof a some test having been performed.
